This is netcdf v3.6.3, the final release of netcdf3.
The configure script was slightly updated to #include <stdlib.h>
in the checks for Fortran to C type correspondances.

If the compilation fails, it might be because this version uses two files
that are specific to the compilation system:
  config.h
  nfconfig.inc

Get the versions for your system and copy them into this folder.
For use with the JAMS makefile, append your system name to the files, e.g. config.h.mcinra

To produce the system-specific files, do
  tar xvzf netcdf-3.6.3-corr.tar.gz
  cd netcdf-3.6.3
  FC=yourF90Compiler F77=yourF77Compiler ./configure --prefix=arbitraryPrefix --enable-shared --enable-f90
In case of gfortran version >= 10, you have to prepend FCFLAGS="-fallow-argument-mismatch" and
FFLAGS="-fallow-argument-mismatch" if you want to make and check the package, i.e.
  FC=gfortran F77=gfortran FCFLAGS="-fallow-argument-mismatch" FFLAGS="-fallow-argument-mismatch" ./configure --prefix=arbitraryPrefix --enable-shared --enable-f90
  make -j 8
  make check

The two files can then be found at
  ./config.h
  fortran/nfconfig.inc

For the JAMS makefile, this is
  cp ./config.h ../config.h.yoursystem
  cp ./fortran/nfconfig.inc ../nfconfig.inc.yoursystem
  cd ..
  \rm -r netcdf-3.6.3
