This is the FORTRAN library of the

Department Computational Hydrosystems
Helmholtz Centre for Environmental Research - UFZ
Permoserstr. 15
04318 Leipzig, Germany

One can produce a browseable html of the library in the directory html by calling: make SRCPATH=. html

The library is maintained with a subversion system at:
https://svn.ufz.de/svn/chs-svn/FORTRAN_chs_lib/

The documentation of the library is maintained as a wiki at:
https://svn.ufz.de/chs-svn/wiki/WikiFortran

The above wiki will be printed to a PDF file from time to time, which is provided in wiki.pdf.
Be aware that the current PDF is not always up to date.

Note on Numerical Recipes
-------------------------
Be aware that some code is under the Numerical Recipes License 3rd
edition <http://www.nr.com/aboutNR3license.html>

The Numerical Recipes Personal Single-User License lets you personally
use Numerical Recipes code ("the code") on any number of computers,
but only one computer at a time. You are not permitted to allow anyone
else to access or use the code. You may, under this license, transfer
precompiled, executable applications incorporating the code to other,
unlicensed, persons, providing that (i) the application is
noncommercial (i.e., does not involve the selling or licensing of the
application for a fee), and (ii) the application was first developed,
compiled, and successfully run by you, and (iii) the code is bound
into the application in such a manner that it cannot be accessed as
individual routines and cannot practicably be unbound and used in
other programs. That is, under this license, your application user
must not be able to use Numerical Recipes code as part of a program
library or "mix and match" workbench.

Businesses and organizations that purchase the disk or code download,
and that thus acquire one or more Numerical Recipes Personal
Single-User Licenses, may permanently assign those licenses, in the
number acquired, to individual employees. Such an assignment must be
made before the code is first used and, once made, it is irrevocable
and can not be transferred. 

If you do not hold a Numerical Recipes License, this code is only for
informational and educational purposes but cannot be used.
