%           
%   Note: B0 is constructed as in Morris design when groups are not considered. When groups are considered the routine
%         follows the following steps:
%           1- Creation of P0 and DD0 matrices defined in Morris for the groups. This means that the dimensions of these
%              2 matrices are (GroupNumber,GroupNumber).
%           2- Creation of AuxMat matrix with (GroupNumber+1,GroupNumber) elements.
%           3- Definition of GroupB0 starting from AuxMat, GroupMat and P0.
%           4- The final B0 for groups is obtained as [ones(sizeb,1)*x0' + GroupB0]. The P0 permutation is present in GroupB0
%              and it's not necessary to permute the matrix (ones(sizeb,1)*x0') because it's already randomly created.
