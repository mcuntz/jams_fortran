!
!! MAIN is the main program for BUFFON_LAPLACE.
!
!  Discussion:
!
!    This program uses MPI to do a Buffon-Laplace simulation in parallel.
!
!    This is an example of an "embarassingly parallel" computation.  Each
!    processor does the same randomized computation, counting "successes",
!    and returning the number of successes to the master process.
!
!    The particular point made by this example is that each process must
!    use a different stream of random numbers, and that this can be done
!    if each process uses a different seed to initialize the random number
!    generator, and that this, in turn, can be done by simply adding the
!    process's rank to a common seed value.

function buffon_laplace_simulate ( a, b, l, trial_num )

!*****************************************************************************80
!
!! BUFFON_LAPLACE_SIMULATE simulates a Buffon-Laplace needle experiment.
!
!  Discussion:
!
!    In the Buffon-Laplace needle experiment, we suppose that the plane has been
!    tiled into a grid of rectangles of width A and height B, and that a
!    needle of length L is dropped "at random" onto this grid.
!
!    We may assume that one end, the "eye" of the needle falls at the point
!    (X1,Y1), taken uniformly at random in the cell [0,A]x[0,B].
!
!    ANGLE, the angle that the needle makes is taken to be uniformly random.
!    The point of the needle, (X2,Y2), therefore lies at
!
!      (X2,Y2) = ( X1+L*cos(ANGLE), Y1+L*sin(ANGLE) )
!
!    The needle will have crossed at least one grid line if any of the
!    following are true:
!
!      X2 <= 0, A <= X2, Y2 <= 0, B <= Y2.
!
!    This routine simulates the tossing of the needle, and returns the number
!    of times that the needle crossed at least one grid line.
!
!    If L is larger than sqrt ( A*A + B*B ), then the needle will
!    cross every time, and the computation is uninteresting.  However, if
!    L is smaller than this limit, then the probability of a crossing on
!    a single trial is
!
!      P(L,A,B) = ( 2 * L * ( A + B ) - L * L ) / ( PI * A * B )
!
!    and therefore, a record of the number of hits for a given number of
!    trials can be used as a very roundabout way of estimating PI.
!    (Particularly roundabout, since we actually will use a good value of
!    PI in order to pick the random angles!)
!
!    Note that this routine will try to generate 5 * TRIAL_NUM random
!    double precision values at one time, using automatic arrays.
!    When I tried this with TRIAL_NUM = 1,000,000, the program failed,
!    because of internal system limits on such arrays.
!
!    Such a problem could be avoided by using a DO loop running through
!    each trial individually, but this tend to run much more slowly than
!    necessary.
!
!    Since this routine invokes the FORTRAN90 random number generator,
!    the user should initialize the random number generator, particularly
!    if it is desired to control whether the sequence is to be varied
!    or repeated.

subroutine random_initialize ( seed_input )

!*****************************************************************************80
!
!! RANDOM_INITIALIZE initializes the FORTRAN90 random number seed.
!
!  Discussion:
!
!    If you don't initialize the FORTRAN90 random number generator
!    routine RANDOM_NUMBER, which is used by calls like
!
!      call random_number ( harvest = x )
!
!    then its behavior is not specified.  That may be OK for you.  But
!    you may want to be able to force the same sequence to be generated
!    each time, or to force a different sequence.
!
!    To control the sequence of random numbers, you need to set the seed.
!    In FORTRAN90, this is done by calling the RANDOM+SEED routine.
!    You can call it with no arguments, in fact.  But if you call
!    it with no arguments:
!
!      call random_seed ( )
!
!    then its behavior (or more particularly, the behavior of RANDOM_NUMBER)
!    is still not specified.  You might hope that the system will go out
!    and pick a nice random seed for you, but there's no guarantee.
!
!
!    For example, on the DEC ALPHA, if you compile a program that calls
!    RANDOM_NUMBER, then every time you run it, you get the same sequence
!    of "random" values.  If you compile a program that calls RANDOM_SEED
!    with no arguments, and then calls RANDOM_NUMBER, you still get the
!    same sequence each time you run the program.
!
!    In order to actually try to scramble up the random number generator
!    a bit, this routine goes through the tedious process of getting the
!    size of the random number seed, making up values based on the current
!    time, and setting the random number seed.
!
!    Unfortunately, the RANDOM_SEED routine has a very elastic definition.
!    It does not use a single scalar integer SEED.  Instead, it communicates
!    with the user through an integer vector whose size is not specified.
!    You actually have to "ask" the routine to tell you the size of this
!    vector.  Then you can fill up the vector with values to be used to
!    influence the seeding of the random number routine.  The details of
!    how the seed affects the sequence are also unspecified, but the only
!    thing we are reasonably confident about is that specifying the same
!    seed should result in the same sequence, and specifying different
!    seeds should result in different sequences!
!
!    I assume this is far more than you wanted to know.  (It's certainly
!    more than I wanted to know!)
!
!    The argument SEED is an input quantity only, so it is legal
!    to type
!
!      call random_initialize ( 0 )
!
!    or
!
!      call random_initialize ( 18867 )
